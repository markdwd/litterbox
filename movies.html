        <p>these are tentative because like most people my preferences change all the time :)
            <br>
              i used to have a bad movies bug but since my attention-span has gotten worse since the start of this latter half of the year, i havent been able to watch any movies so these thoughts are extremely dated.
              <br>
              there'll also be spoilers in some of my thoughts so be warned.

                <h2>Dune: Part Two - Denis Villeneuve</h2>
                <p>this movie is only in here because of recency bias. not to demean it and say its bad or whatever, its great actually. i saw this movie two times, alone and at my own expense (my budget is extremely tight and i barely actually go to the theater because i can just watch it online *wink* *wink*). i say recency bias because im sure if my movie bug didnt die out, it'd have put a better movie than this one but regardless its here so whatever. unsurprisingly i like this better than the first one, there are actual stuff happening in here and it didnt feel as slow. the action is great, the pacing is better, the cinematography is on point (i mean its made by denis villeneuve so yknow). not much else to say, cant wait for the next one.

                <h2>The Big Short - Adam McKay</h2>
                <p>im not even gonna pretend i understand half of what was going on in this movie. all the accounting and economic, wall-street trading jargon is completely lost on me but thats fine because all i need to see is Steve Carell's character stressing all over the place to know that if shit hits the fan itll be all over. other than that though, the casting for this movie is ridiculous, i mean 'Christian Bale', 'Ryan Gosling', 'Brad Pitt', and all the guest appearances is absurd. the actual comedy is hilarious, the tension in a lot of the scenes can equal 'Uncut Gems' in how dramatic and actually stress-inducing they can be on the viewer, and most of all the dialogue is phenomenal. it does have some of the hollywood sitcom-esc writing with all the weird quirky speech nonsense but the way the actors deliver some of these lines elevates the entire movie hard. great hilarious movie all around.

                <h2>Nightcrawler - Dan Gilroy</h2>
                <p>this movie is just utterly and i mean utterly fucked up. not in a gory way but just the very latter half of it is just painful to think about. 'Jake Gyllenhaal' is a 10/10 psychopath, the way he acts his character 'Lou' trying to emulate normal human behaviour and mannuerisms but still coming off as somewhat 'not in there' is creepy as hell to watch. watching Lou's exploit all across Los Angeles is simultaneously fun and exciting to watch, due in part because of the great cinematography and atmosphere of late night L.A as well as all the crazy stuff Lou himself gets into. i honestly wanted to put 'End of Watch' instead of this but the more i think about which one i would definitively have on a list like this made me put this above it. RIP Rick :(

                <h2>Oldboy - Park Chan-wook</h2>
                <p>nevermind this is actually more fucked up than 'Nightcrawler'. i love how the first sort of 'part' of this movie like starts off with some psychological mind-fuck scenarios with the main character being imprisoned and him trying to make sense of whats happening. then once he finds the light at the end of the tunnel and escapes and then subsequently meet the girl (i dont remember her name), it turns into a macho man, john wick-esc, action movie with crazy cuts and crazy stunts. and then for it all to wrap back around to mind-fuckery stuff with the insane plot twist reveal about the girl and the main antagonist. ngl that moment still hurts to think about which is why i've avoided trying to rewatch this movie even for how great it is. great mystery-thriller, would never watch again.

                <h2>Chungking Express - Wong Kar-Wai</h2>
                <p>this movie is in the same space i have 'Yotsuba&!' in my brain for how special it is to me. not because for how intellectually different it is or whatever but just for how melancholic it is. i watched this during the pandemic, i think right around the peak of lockdown, and the atmmosphere and the aesthetics of this movie just gave me so much comfort. theres nothing like superbly special about it other than its presentation. if you ask me what i thought this movie meant or even what was going on, i wouldnt be able to tell you but just watching it and being immersed in late 90's Hong Kong with the lights everywhere and that 'Wong Kar-Wai' effect idk what its called is angelic to watch. however, the main thing for me here, and probably for a lot of other people, is the music. the soundtrack for this movie is bar none. all the scenes with the short haired girl just vibing to california dreaming is so gravitating to watch. whenever i need a movie to watch during those cold late night insomniac times, this is what i put on 10 out of 10 times.

                <h2>'Scott Pilgrim vs The World' & 'Superbad' by Edgar Wright, & Greg Mottola</h2>
                <p>this is a double entry purely because of 'Micheal Cera' lmao. i really miss these mid 2000's slapstick comedy movies about just random stuff happening to a ragtag cast of whoever's. 'Scott Pilgrim vs The World' & 'Superbad' is a super fun action comedy movie with lots of video game and just general pop culture references that makes it fun to watch along with the ridiculous cast as crazy as 'The Big Short', 'Aubrey Plaza', 'Chris Evans', 'Brie Larson', and 'Kieran Culkin' is a great list of actors to play the ridiculous things thats happening in this movie. 'Superbad' spawned so much pop culture jokes in and of itself for good reason. the main trio of 'Jonal Hill', 'Micheal Cera', and of course 'Christopher Mintz-Plasse' as Fogell or sorry 'McLovin'. actual peak cinema none of 'Martin Scorsese' or 'Stanley Kubrick' movies can topple the quality of these two grand pieces of cinema.
