                <h2>Yeezus - Kanye West</h2>
                <p> 2013 was not ready for this album and even now it has stood the test of time. arguably, i understand
                    that this, compared to his other albums, may not be the most emotionally packed project of his, but
                    the sounds and the tracklist makes me like this so much more than his other ones. 10 tracks of
                    nothing but straight heat, no fluff, makes the album easy to digest and along with the hard hitting
                    industrial type beats, extremely memorable. best Ye album ngl. Yeezus > MBDTF all day.

                <h2>Die Lit - Playboi Carti</h2>
                <p> quintessential trap album of the modern era. i'm willing to say that most of the sounds of hiphop and
                    maybe even pop songs was inspired from this. it's not at all a emotional or philosophical album like
                    c'mon it's Carti but the way this project sounds is super enjoyable. i will say that 'Whole Lotta Red'
                    has a much more bigger influential impact on the hip'hop scene as a whole compared this but as a project in its entirety, this is just
                    so much better. there could be a better example of ;the quintessential trap album' from like Future or whoever but i
                    havent heard it yet so this is what ill say is "THE BEST TRAP ALBUM" out rn.

                <h2>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers - Kendrick Lamar</h2>
                <p> this album is like listening to a person's mind unraveling during the middle of a therapy session.
                    the honesty in the way kendrick tells his story and the way he tries to piece together the events
                    that has happened to his life and the way it has affected him and his journey through it all is
                    amazing. out of the 5 in this list, this is definitely the most emotionally charged project on here.
                    "Auntie Diaries", "Father Time", and "Count Me Out" are some of the songs that hit me the hardest in this project.
                    it's not as replayable as the other albums in here but sitting down once and a while to listen to its
                    entirety is basically free therapy so its thats an added bonus.

                <h2>The Melodic Blue - Baby Keem</h2>
                <p> this album is basically like mixing Kanye's production, Kendrick's voice and flow, and Carti's rapping style. it has a good balance of emotional
                    tracks along with club & head bangers but its main thing is the sound. the atmosphere and the
                    variety of <i>melodies</i> (get it?) is phenomenal. also what i mean by "Carti's rapping" is because
                    while the sounds are great, his bars are, at the very least, hilarious, which is fine to me, not
                    everybody has to be like kendrick and unravel their entire life on a project but still if you dont like
                    just sometimes nonsensical rapping then youd be pretty turned off from this. <i>also i hate him
                        because its been 3 years and he hasnt dropped another album yet, guy thinks hes frank ocean.
                        dudes getting on my nerves istg.</i>

                    much all the songs here, and the rapping is great too. i dont really have much to say, its an
                    amazing album this early into their career and im really excited for their next album and i hope
                    their career blows up even further.
