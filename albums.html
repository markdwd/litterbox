                <h2>Yeezus - Kanye West</h2>
                <p>2013 was not ready for this album and even now it has stood the test of time. Arguably, I understand
                    that this, compared to his other albums, may not be the most emotionally packed project of his, but
                    the sounds and the tracklist make me like this so much more than his other ones. 10 tracks of
                    nothing but straight heat, no fluff, makes the album easy to digest and along with the hard-hitting
                    industrial type beats, extremely memorable. Best Ye album, ngl. Yeezus > MBDTF all day.</p>

                <h2>Die Lit - Playboi Carti</h2>
                <p>quintessential trap album of the modern era. i'm willing to say that most of the sounds of hiphop
                    and
                    maybe even pop songs was inspired from this. it's not at all a emotional or philosophical album like
                    c'mon it's Carti but the way this project sounds is super enjoyable. i will say that 'Whole Lotta
                    Red'
                    has a much more bigger influential impact on the hip'hop scene as a whole compared this but as a
                    project
                    in its entirety, this is just
                    so much better. there could be a better example of ;the quintessential trap album' from like Future
                    or
                    whoever but i
                    havent heard it yet so this is what ill say is "THE BEST TRAP ALBUM" out rn.</p>

                <h2>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers - Kendrick Lamar</h2>
                <p>this album is like listening to a person's mind unraveling during the middle of a therapy session.
                    the honesty in the way kendrick tells his story and the way he tries to piece together the events
                    that has happened to his life and the way it has affected him and his journey through it all is
                    amazing. out of the 5 in this list, this is definitely the most emotionally charged project on here.
                    "Auntie Diaries", "Father Time", and "Count Me Out" are some of the songs that hit me the hardest in
                    this project.
                    it's not as replayable as the other albums in here but sitting down once and a while to listen to
                    its
                    entirety is basically free therapy so its thats an added bonus.</p>

                    rapping
                    style. it has a good balance of emotional
                    tracks along with club & head bangers but its main thing is the sound. the atmosphere and the
                    variety of <i>melodies</i> (get it?) is phenomenal. also what i mean by "Carti's rapping" is because
                    while the sounds are great, his bars are, at the very least, hilarious, which is fine to me, not
                    everybody has to be like kendrick and unravel their entire life on a project but still if you dont
                    like
                    just sometimes nonsensical rapping then youd be pretty turned off from this. <i>also i hate him
                        because its been 3 years and he hasnt dropped another album yet, guy thinks hes frank ocean.

                <h2>BULLY - Kanye West</h2>
                <p>this'll be Ye's solo album after the 'Vultures' albums. particularly excited for this because 1. its
                    a new Ye album 2. Ye is at an interesting point in his career right now. i say this because of a few
                    reasons, the 'Vultures' albums, while i personally enjoyed a lot, is very controversial in the
                    community. both from Ye's own fans and the rest of the hip'hop community, divided listeners with
                    some enjoying it while others thought some negative sentiments about it. with the first volume
                    having a rocky rollout, wildy sexual aspects (mind you his last album was a gospel album), and a few
                    delays still had a solid run and even had a top charting song with 'Carnival'. the second volume
                    however was delayed even further after the first, and once it dropped, had very very bad mixing,
                    literally no rollout, and weird song choices. it got updated as weeks go by though with the most
                    controversial updates yet, adding AI vocals ontop of verses by another artist's on the album and
                    some entirely from scratch. granted there are still great songs on both volumes, and with songs
                    played during concerts that areconfirmed to be on the album still having AI vocals, itll be
                    interesting to see where Ye will go with this solo album and whether or not he'll keep using AI as a
                    tool in his music.

                <h2>I AM MUSIC - Playboi Carti</h2>
                <p>this guy had an extremely mixed reaction to his christmas day drop album 'Whole Lotta Red' that was
                    executively produced by Ye that then over the years became a hit sensation with so much songs on it
                    going viral on tiktok and wherever. after all of that though, this stupid dumb vampire woman beater
                    opiod addicted moron decides to constantly announce a project, start a rollout, let it die out, and
                    then revive it with another announcment. hes done this for literally 3 and counting years. the only
                    reason this guy is still around is because his dumb fanbase (me included) keeps falling for his
                    mysterious guy act after he goes quiet for months and then drops a fit pic on insta and then drops a
                    new song snippet then disappears again.

                <p>nav has a reputation of being a super generic hip'hop artist that literally does and adds nothing to
                    the scene as a whole nor does he do anything interesting or evern really different anything in his
                    songs and projects but holy do they sound great. like i said, im not a guy who thinks every and all
                    musical project should be intellectually progressive or whatever so nav just talking about drugs and
                    flexing in the least orignial way possible absolutely hits for me. he teased this album having a
                    'Playboi Carti' feature and theres been images of them meeting up so thats also definitely a plus.

                    has been right about unreleased information before, saying that he planned to drop two albums

                <h2>? - Kendrick Lamar</h2>
                <p>this entry is also pretty dubious. it just stems from the fact that before a new album drop, a 'The
                    Heart Part-' single drops before it. and his newest drop 'GNX' has a song title 'heart pt. 6' along
                    with the pretty short run of it suggests the idea that it isnt the full album and that theres more
                    to come. theres also the 'SuperBowl' performance next year which would be the perfect time to drop
                    and some of Kendrick's close associates saying that hes working on some stuff and whatnot.<i> cover

                <p>this one is just basically the same sentiments that i reserve for Carti. matter of fact, he had a
                    better received initial album drop with 'The Melodic Blue' compared to 'Whole Lotta Red' along with
                    the Kendrick co-sign, made this man be at a better spot than Carti was with all the hype and
                    excitement towards him. then he goes quiet for 2 years nearing 3 after this year with nothing to
                    work with. theres a few snippets here and there but i havent heard any and i dont care enough at
                    this point to look for even leaks so im left with nothing but the actual album dropping at some far
                    off point in time. still excited tho.</i>
