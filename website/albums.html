                    <h2>Yeezus - Kanye West</h2>
                    <p> 2013 was not ready for this album and even now it has stood the test of time. Arguably, i understand that this, compared to this other albums, may not be the most emotionally packed project of his, but the sounds and the tracklist makes me like this so much more than his other ones. 10 tracks of nothing but straight heat, no fluff, makes the album easy to digest and along with the hard hitting industrial type beats, extremely memorable. Best Ye album ngl. Yeezus > MBDTF all day.</p>

                    <h2>Die Lit - Playboi Carti</h2>
                    <p> Quintessential Trap album of the modern era. Im willing to say that most of the sounds of hiphop and maybe even pop songs was inspired from this. It's not at all a emotional or philosophical album like cmon is Carti but the way this project sounds is super enjoyable. I will say that Whole Lotta Red has a much more bigger influencial impact than this but as a project in its entirety, this is just so much better. There maybe a better example of a trap album from like future or whoever but i havent heard it yet so this is what ill say as THE BEST TRAP ALBUM out rn.</p>

                    <h2>Mr. Morale & The Big Steppers - Kendrick Lamar</h2>
                    <p> This album is like listening to a person's mind unfolding in the middle of like a therapy session. The honesty in the way kendrick tells his story and the way he tries to piece together the things that has happened to his life and the way it has affected him and his journey through it all is amazing. Out of the 5 in this list, this is definitely the most emotionally charged project on here. "Auntie Diaries", "Father Time", and "Count Me Out" are the songs that hit me the hardest in this. It's not as replayable as the other albums here but sitting down once and a while to listen to its entirety is basically free therapy so its real useful.</p>

                    <h2>The Melodic Blue - Baby Keem</h2>
                    <p> Now this album is basically like if you combined Kanye West's production abilities, Kendrick's voice & cadence, along with Carti's rapping, this is what you'd get. It has a good balance of emotional tracks along with club & head bangers but its main thing is the sound. The atmosphere and the variety of <i>melodies</i> (get it?) is phenomenal. Now notice i said "Carti's rapping" because while the sounds are great, his bars are, at the very least, hilarious, which is fine to me not everybody has to be kendrick and unravel their entire life on a project but still if you dont like just sometimes nonsensical rapping then youd be pretty turned off from this. <i>also i hate him because its been 3 years and he hasnt dropped another album yet, guy thinks hes frank ocean. dudes getting on my nerves istg.</i></p>

                    <h2>#gigi - skaiwater</h2>
                    <p> Best undergroud artist rn. This album is proof all you need is a great melody and whatever instruments to make a great track. The vocals here are great, the mixing is great, i like pretty much all the songs here, and the rapping is great too. I dont really have much to say, its an amazing album this early into their career and im really excited for their next album and i hope their career blows up even further.</p>
