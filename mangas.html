      manga = japanese comics.

      <h2>Yotsuba&! - Azuma Kiyohiko</h2>
      <div class="peak-container">
        <p class="peak"> best peace of fiction ever. <br> but seriously and in all honesty, this is genuinely my utmost
          favorite manga
          ever. its a great read on any mood. sad, happy, bored, and whatnot. Yotsuba is a great character, the humor
          is on point, the dialogue feels real, and the overall manga just makes me feel like im a kid again.
          Yotsuba's interactions with all the other side characters are also really funny and her plethora of
          adventures is really fun to read. i tend to forget about this series though since it doesnt get updated
          often but its one of the very few mangas where im genuinely excited to read when i see that theres a new
          chapter out.

      <h2>The Dangers in My Heart - Sakurai Norio</h2>
      <p> the only actually good rom-com. i'm a big fan of rom-coms but most of them feel like the author hasnt been in
        touch or in contact with a woman for their entire life. this reads like the characters are genuinely teenagers
        and not just exagerrated to be really dumb. the cringe stuff that happens and they do doesnt detract from the
        experience because they arent done horribly and actually help in developing the plot and relationship as a
        whole. it's a bit of a slow burn but the progression is really satisfying and the main characters are really
        cute together :)

      <h2>The Fable - Minami Katsuhisa</h2>
      <p> my favorate Seinen manga. i'm not a big fan of a lot of Seinen since most are really grim or gory for no
        rhyme or reason which i really dislike. this one though isnt like that at all and isnt usually too
        over-the-top in its presentation. what it is though is an equally dark and funny series with a really mature
        outlook on its setting. it doesnt take itself too seriously but it knows the appropriate times when it needs
        to which makes this a great read. the only other Seinen that i'd consider replacing this with is Ajin which is
        also a pretty great manga to read. i dont know the status of this, whether it still ongoing and whatnot, but i
        hope it isnt done yet because id love to see more from this story.

      <h2>Dandadan - Tatsu Yukinobu</h2>
      <p> out of all the series thats in the 'Shounen Jump' lineup right now, i think this has the most potential to
        reach the heights of other series like one punch man season 1 or the peak of jojo's bizzare adventure back in
        like 2016
        or 2017 or something. this has all the ingredients to garner a huge fanbase and for good reasons. an actually
        entertaining and great romance plot which is rare on 'Shounen Jump', solid plot, great cast, and amazing art.
        based from the ongoing and already foreshadowed plot points, it seems like this'll be one of those long
        running 400 chapter esc series and i hope it is. 'Shounen Jump' currently is lacking another massive series
        right now
        other than 'One Piece' and this seems like a great contender to be running alongside it.

      <h2>Blue Lock - Kaneshiro Muneyuki & Nomura Yuusuke</h2>
      <p> if realism is the only bar for sports mangas then i wouldve gone for 'Ao aoshi' or 'Haikyuu' instead of this
        one but thank god it
        isnt because this series is genuinely hype as hell. it is absolutely edgy as hell and bordering most of the
        times between being somewhat feasible to physically impossible moves but regardless, the characters and their
        rivalries along with the amazing art makes this a better read for me than the other aforementioned series.

      <h2>Kagurabachi - Hokazono Takeru</h2>
      <p> if 'Jujutsu Kaisen' was still ongoing and if the ending for it was a bit better then i wouldve gone with that
        but
        since those didnt happen im going with this one. the notoriety of this series starting with a meme clowning on
        it was, looking back at it, a great event because it made people pay attention to this and thankfully it was
        able to
        deliver regardless. the art is phenomenal, the plot is great, and the power system is cool. i see this running
        around the
        same ballpark as 'Jujutsu Kaisen', ending at around 250 or so chapters but still, wherever this story takes me,
        i am very
        much along for the ride.

  <h1 class="mh">manhwa:</h1>
  <p class="mp">my thoughts for these series are going to be a lot more brief as i dont read as much manhwa as i do with
    manga's but i still like them a lot so im listing them regardless.</p>

      <h2>Wind Breaker - Jo, Yongseok</h2>
      <p> this is like the same case as 'Blue Lock' where i have no idea how true or possible whatever they say or do on
        here but it still slaps so i dont care. the art is great here and the presentation is on point.
        it's funny to me how dramatic and over-the-top a series about biking can be (they have gangs and whole
        international corporations as antagonists lmao) but still the delivery is fire so its fine to me.

      <h2>Lookism - Park, Tae-Jun</h2>
      <p> i should honestly list this as two seperate series because of how distinctly different the first and second
        half are to each other. the first half of this is a slice-of-life comedy with some drama and romance about being
        bullied, ugly, and the concept of "lookism" in society. the second half is about teenage gangwars, inhuman
        superpowers, and a lot of fights. i still very much like what it is now since its a good turn-off-your-brain
        read but ngl i still miss the early lookism days.

      <h2>The Greatest Estate Developer - Moon, Back-kyung & Kim, Hyunsoo</h2>
      <p> funniest manhwa hands down. its your typical slap stick over the top comedy but the delivery of this isnt
        cringy so that sets itself apart. it knows when to take itself seriously and slow down the pacing for the
        emotional parts and then ramp it up again for the comedy and even action.

      <h2>Villains Are Destined to Die - Gwon, Gyeoeul & SUOL</h2>
      <p> only 'Otome' (japanese word thats also used for this genre, basically means content targeted for women) i
        actively follow. i've read a few others but none has been able to capture the magic this one has. the art is
        phenomenal but the main thing about it is the story, the drama and the romance in this is top notch and i like
        all the female main character's love interests. it also has its light side sometimes, taking its time to slow
        down and chill and whatnot but the drama is still where its strength lies.
